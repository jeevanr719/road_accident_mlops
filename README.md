It aligns with **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being**, aiming to reduce road fatalities.

## Pipeline Overview
1. `preprocess.py` — Cleans, encodes, and saves data.
2. `train.py` — Trains Random Forest model.
3. `predict.py` — Runs predictions on sample data.

## Commands
```bash
python src/preprocess.py
python src/train.py
python src/predict.py
